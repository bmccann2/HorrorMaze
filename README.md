# HorrorMaze
In 2017 I took an Intro to Game Design course. At the end of the semester a partner and I created a Horror Maze as our final project. The game requires the user to try to escape the Haunted House by randomly opening doors searching for the exit. However some doors have monsters behind them and if you accidentally come across one you lose.
